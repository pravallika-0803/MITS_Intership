# Micro IT Internship Projects

This repository contains two distinct projects developed during my Micro IT internship, showcasing my skills in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend development (Java with Spring Boot).

Project 1: Calculator 
This project is a fully functional web-based calculator developed using fundamental web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive logic. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

Features

* Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Project 2: To-Do List Application
This project is a RESTful API for a simple To-Do List application, built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. It provides endpoints for managing tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting to-do items. This project demonstrates core backend development concepts such as API design, data persistence.

Features

* Create To-Do Items: Add new tasks with a description and status.
* Retrieve To-Do Items: Get all tasks or a specific task by ID.
* Update To-Do Items: Modify existing tasks.
* Delete To-Do Items: Remove tasks from the list.
* H2 Database: In-memory database for quick setup and testing.
* RESTful API Design: Adheres to REST principles for clear and organized endpoints.

Technologies Used

* Java 11
* Spring Boot 3.x
* Gradle
* Spring Data JPA
* H2 Database
* Lombok
